    // For web applications targeting modern web browsers, the lib array should include typings for

    // recent ECMAScript features.

    // * "dom" and "dom.iterable" provide typings for web APIs and DOM operations, crucial for
    //   web development and user interactions within a React app. "dom.iterable" enhances support
    //   for iterable collections in the DOM, allowing for more natural iteration patterns.

    //   or through polyfills and bundlers.
